# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Background and Purpose
Louise's new play, Fever, was close to its funding goal and she wanted to know how other campaigns were doing. This analysis aims to assist Louise in seeing how different campaigns performed in relation to her launch date and funding goals. Based on the launch dates and funding goals of different campaigns, we can estimate whether her play would succeed or fail.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Although there were no significant challenges, if the criteria were to be modified, for example adding more filtering or narrower goal ranges, then using the COUNTIFS() function would become very lengthy and complicated and be susceptible to wrong inputs.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Our first conclusion from the Theater Outcomes By Launch Date graph is that in May, campaigns were usually the most successful. It had the highest count of success outcomes at a value of 111. However, success rates also seems to steadily decrease after May. From the graph, we can also conclude that while failure was on average around 40, in May and October failure was higher with a count of 52 and 50, respectively.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

According to the Outcomes based on Goals graph, the fewer the goals were, the more likely the campaigns were to succeed. Goals with less than $1000 had around a 75% chance to succeed and would decrease to 50% at a goal of $20,000. While there were also 67% of successes at $35,000 to $44,999, we cannot analyze that because the total number of campaigns in that range is 9, so we do not have enough data.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Some limitations of this dataset are the lack of sample size for larger goals. Most campaigns have smaller goals, and it is hard to analyze whether larger goals were more likely to succeed or fail. Another limitation of this dataset is that there were no specific reasons why some campaigns succeeded or failed. We are looking at trends of time and money to see a campaign's outcome.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Another possible table/graph we could have created was the success/fail/canceled outcomes based on the time length of campaigns. We would have been able to determine if patterns of campaign outcomes are based on the duration of campaigns.
